# RootzFX Engine

RootzFX is a smart FX engine for guitar, bass, and vocals that thinks like your favorite record. It dynamically maps effects based on BPM, key, or artist metadata—then routes presets live through MIDI pedal input. From dub delays to Hendrix fuzz, RootzFX isn't just a pedalboard. It's a vibe machine.

## Features
- Style-based FX profiles (e.g., Jimmy Page, Janis Joplin)
- MIDI control integration (e.g., FCB1010)
- Real-time FX chain switching by song metadata
- Audio & voice FX modes supported

## Ideal Setup
- MIDI pedal → Raspberry Pi → FX apps (e.g., ToneStack Pro)
- Metadata from track or AI tagger → preset mapping
